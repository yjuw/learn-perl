awk 'pattern{action}' file

pattern is the condition that is executed if the pattern matches
If the pattern is not present, the action will be executed for every line.
If the action is missing, every line will be printed

awk '{print $1}' file1
will print the first word of every line (default seems to split by space)

awk 'NR!=1{print $1}' file1
NR denotes line number. NR!=1 means to not execute the action part for the first line of the file
will print the first word but omit the header

awk '{print $0}' file1
prints entire file. $0 represents the entire line

awk '1' file1
will also print the entire file. 1 means true which means true for every line
